some examples of MPC:
1. you need to run the file 'setup' to set up the following examples.

2. the file 'simpleMPC_example' offers a simple model to run the MPC, which is also used
to compare LQR.

3. the file 'vdposcillator_example' offers a Van der Pol oscillator(vdposcillator) model to run the linear MPC
and nonlinear MPC.

4. the file 'cstr_example' offers a Continuous stirred-tank reactor(CSTR) model to run the linear MPC
and nonlinear MPC.

5. the paper 'MPC for nonlinear systems: a comparative review of discretization methods' explained these 
examples in detail.
